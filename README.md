Real-Time Social Media Trend Analysis Dashboard Using NewsAPI: A Multi-Dimensional Visualization Platform

Abstract:
This paper presents a real-time trend analysis dashboard that aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes trending topics from news data using NewsAPI. Leveraging FastAPI for the backend and React with Plotly.js for the frontend, the platform delivers insights into trend popularity, sentiment distribution, temporal activity, and geographical patterns. A keyword-based sentiment algorithm and a modular data processing pipeline enable scalable and region-specific trend insights, assisting businesses, analysts, and content strategists in data-driven decision-making.

1. Introduction
In the digital age, real-time trend analysis has become essential for organizations seeking to monitor public sentiment, emerging topics, and media narratives. Traditional social media analytics platforms often focus on specific platforms (e.g., Twitter), overlooking broader news coverage. This paper introduces a trend analysis dashboard that aggregates and visualizes news-based trends across dimensions such as sentiment, time, and geography using real-time data from NewsAPI.

2. Related Work
Existing systems like Google Trends, Brandwatch, and Sprout Social offer varying degrees of trend analysis, but often lack real-time flexibility, geographical granularity, or open-source accessibility. Unlike many proprietary solutions, this dashboard emphasizes interpretability, cross-platform data ingestion, and modular architecture.

3. System Architecture and Methodology
3.1 Backend (FastAPI)
Built with FastAPI for asynchronous and efficient data processing.
Provides six API endpoints for analytics and health monitoring.
Integrates NewsAPI for fetching real-time news headlines across multiple regions.
3.2 Data Processing Pipeline
Trend Extraction: Extracts hashtags and capitalized keywords.
Sentiment Analysis: Custom keyword-based scoring algorithm.
Geographical Mapping: Country and city-based sentiment aggregation using real coordinates.
Temporal Simulation: Mimics 24-hour trend cycles based on peak hours.
3.3 Frontend (React + Plotly.js)
Interactive and responsive UI built with React.
Visualizations via Plotly.js (bar charts, line graphs, choropleth maps).
State management using hooks; Axios handles API requests.

4. Core Features and Functionalities
Trend Popularity Analysis: Identifies and visualizes top 8 trending keywords.
Sentiment Analysis Chart: Sentiment score (-1 to +1) mapped against hashtags.
Temporal Trends: Simulates hourly trend activity across regions.
Geographical Sentiment Map: Displays sentiment per country and city.
News Aggregation: Enables custom search queries and sorting of articles.

5. Implementation and Technical Details
Environment: Python (FastAPI), JavaScript (React), Plotly.js, Axios
APIs:
o/trends/popularity
o/trends/sentiment
o/trends/temporal
o/trends/geographical
o/news
o/health
Deployment:
oBackend with Uvicorn server
oFrontend with React dev server
oEnvironment variables used for API key management
oCORS configured for frontend-backend integration

6. Results and Case Study
Using sample real-time data from NewsAPI across five countries, the dashboard revealed significant insights:
Trending Keywords: Correlated with major events like elections and tech product launches.
Sentiment Patterns: Higher negative sentiment in political and crisis-related articles.
Temporal Analysis: Peaks in activity between 9 AM to 6 PM in respective time zones.
Geographical Analysis: Varied sentiment intensity across regions, especially between Western and Asian media coverage.

7. Discussion
The system demonstrates high responsiveness and scalability for real-time news analysis. However, challenges include:
Keyword-based sentiment scoring has limitations in sarcasm or nuanced language.
NewsAPI rate limits may restrict scalability for enterprise use.
Expanding to multilingual sentiment analysis remains a future goal.

8. Conclusion and Future Work
This paper presents a modular, real-time trend analysis dashboard leveraging news data to extract valuable insights across sentiment, geography, and time. Future improvements include integrating machine learning-based sentiment models, support for multiple data sources (e.g., Twitter, Reddit), and real-time WebSocket-based data streaming.
